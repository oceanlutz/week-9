                    <p class="card-text">The frilled shark (Chlamydoselachus anguineus) is regarded by many
                        as a living fossil, due to the several features it shares with the extinct subclass of 
                        cartilaginous fish (a group containing now sharks, rays, skates, sawfish etc.) that are 
                        no longer found in any of these other descendents today. These features include long jaws 
                        with trident-shaped, multi-cusp teeth; amphistyly, the direct articulation of the jaws to 
                        the cranium, at a point behind the eyes; and a quasi-cartilaginous notochord (a proto-
                        spinal-column) composed of indistinct vertebrae. It gets its common name from the frilled 
                        appearance of the 6 gill slits it has on each side (that being yet another trait not 
                        commonly shared with other sharks today). You can read more about them here on Wikipedia, 
                        the place I happened to have taken most of this infomation from anyways.

                    </h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Mantis Shrimps are marine crustaceans with a carnivorous diet that 
                        can range generally between 10-15cm long during adulthood. The mantis shrimp is a 
                        pugilist at heart, with its claws being the evolutionary pinnacle of close-ranged claw-to-claw 
                        combat. When punching unlucky sea creatures (and ill-fated humans that choose their own demise) 
                        they can accelerate these iron fists to 102,000 m/s<sup>2</sup> (10,400 g) and speeds of 23 m/s. 
                        These strikes cause water cavitation (literally turning the water it punches into vapor) and the 
                        resulting shock wave is enough on its own without the physical strike to incapacitate most prey. 
                        They are also believed to have the most complex eyesight in the animal kingdom. Their eyes actually 
                        function better than any manmade optical technology in terms of performing uniformly over the entire 
                        visual spectrum, and can be the inspiration for future technology to which current Blu-ray technology 
                        pales in comparison. I also have a sick tattoo of one.

                    <p class="card-text">This is the last for now before I get too carried away, but here I decided to 
                        just group the entire class of Cephalopoda. This includes creatures such as squids, octopuses, 
                        cuttlefish, and the nautilus pictured above. They are considered the most intelligent invertibrates 
                        and have both large brains and well-developed senses. Their nervous systems are also the most complex 
                        of all invertibrates. Cephalopods for this reason are notoriously difficult to keep in captivity, 
                        and have been known to escape aquarium enclosures and journey to other enclosures to feed on crabs 
                        before returning to their little glass prison. Most also contain skin components that make it possible 
                        to interact with light. Along with using these components for changing color for camouflage, they can 
                        also create bioluminescence or use other colors or patterns to communicate. Some species, like the 
                        sand-dwelling octopus, use the flexibility of their own bodies along with the ability to change colors 
                        to mimic other creatures (the sand-dwelling octopus in particular mimicking both the colors and the 
                        swim movements of a particular sand-dwelling flounder). Cephalopods are basically underwater aliens.
