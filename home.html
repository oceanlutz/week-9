            literally took me forever to realize that putting the brand name
            here after the button kept it from disappearing under md breakpoint
            but putting it after the div underneath it causes it to disappear and 
            reappear in the dropdown, but it still moves to the left of the screen  
            before the breakpoint so i had to make this brand disappear under
            the breakpoint and the brand lower down there disappear above the breakpoint
            *cries*

            this wouldn't have taken me so long if i just kept the brand on the
